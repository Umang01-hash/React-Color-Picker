## React Color Picker 

 A clone of websites like [Flat UI Colors](https://flatuicolors.com/) and [Material UI Colors](http://materialuicolors.co/?utm_source=launchers).
This project is an application from the great complete react.js course by Colt Steele on Udemy.
In this project I developped a React app that manages palettes of colors using various utilities:

- react-router
- chroma-js
- react-copy-to-clipboard
- rc-slider
- material-ui
- JSS & withStyles
- react-sortable-hoc
- react-color
- react-material-ui-form-validator
- react-transition-group
- emoji-mart
